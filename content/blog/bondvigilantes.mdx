The Bond Vigilantes is an industry leading blog from M&G Investments. I have been working with M&G on BV for 7 years and played a small part in its incredible growth.

Over the years I have:
- Led the development team which rebuilt the site in WordPress and continuously enhanced its functionality. 
- Salvaged a WordPress database to restore 17 years of missing content.
- Successfully managing the complex migration of the site from Adobe AEM to WordPress.
- Serving as the dedicated Account Manager, overseeing all project needs, delivering monthly reports, and maintaining strong client communication through weekly calls.
- Successfully managed client relations to help retain the client for 7 years.
