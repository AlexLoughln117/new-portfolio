Reside Worldwide is one of the largest apart-hotel brands in the USA. With ambitious expansion plans, it needed a new website that explained its vision to the world.

For this project, I was the Account manager:
- Managed the end-to-end project delivery, including meetings, planning and development.
- Worked directly with an external agency that handled the website design.
- Served as the primary client contact and liaison, managing relationships with the client and an external design agency.
- Collaborated with a developer on website execution, contributing to the project's completion within a 6-week timeframe from final design to launch.
- The development portion of the website was completed in a record two weeks.
