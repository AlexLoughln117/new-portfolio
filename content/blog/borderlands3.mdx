Borderlands 3 has forced me to admit something horrible and worrying about myself. I am faced with the fact that my own humour and what I find funny might not be as highbrow or sophisticated as I want to believe. Upon Borderlands return, the internet in a rare moment of agreement decided that it was no longer funny and probably never had been funny. So imagine my shock when playing Borderlands 3 I discovered myself laughing at the jokes and enjoying the writing. Was the internet wrong, was Borderlands still funny or was my humour just stuck in 2009?

Who would have thought Borderlands could cause such an existential crisis of self-belief? But now I am resigned to never believe anything I read on the internet(!?) So I have decided that Borderlands is still funny and so Iâ€™m allowed to like it.
