Active Lambeth took ownership of 8 leisure centres in-house from external provider Better and we worked with them to create a new website in record time. 

Throughout this project, I have:
- Spearheaded the development team which built a new 175-page website in WordPress.
- Website built within 4 weeks of design approval. 
- Transitioned from Development Lead to Account Lead post-launch, taking full ownership of the client relationship and ongoing project delivery.
- Drove continuous website improvements post-launch, collaborating with the client to enhance user experience and service delivery.
- Managed delivery of social media and digital advertising.
- Successfully managed the client relationship, including social media and digital advertising delivery, securing a 3-year client retention.
