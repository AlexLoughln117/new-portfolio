Okami HD is a 2018 re-release of Clover Studio’s seminal 2006 PS2 action-adventure game. Simply put, if you enjoy The Legend of Zelda-style games or action-adventure in general, you must play Okami. It is one of the finest examples of this genre and holds up excellently today. Okami delivered a Zelda-style experience that arguably surpassed The Twilight Princess, which was released the same year. A beautiful game which was the crowning achievement of Clover Studios upon release, Okami deserves a place on everyone's shelf.

Before we discuss anything else, the one thing which I guarantee will grab your attention about Okami is the absolutely incredible visuals. The whole game is rendered in the traditional Japanese sumi-e painting style, characterized by bold black ink wash borders filled with vibrant watercolours. Imagine the Studio Ghibli film Princess Kaguya, but released ten years earlier and arguably executed even better – that gives you some idea of Okami's unparalleled sumi-e visuals.

This unique style is even more beautiful today than it was all those years ago. It is also woven into the story and gameplay well, having you use brush strokes to alter the environment and return colour to a world where it has been drained away. Okami perfectly demonstrates how strong art direction trumps sheer graphical power, as it looks timeless compared to its 2006 contemporaries. Look at the drab, blocky worlds of Twilight Princess to see how well the style of Okami holds up in comparison.
This re-release also allows Okami to shine visually in a way it never could in its initial PS2 incarnation. Running in full HD and widescreen is the way this game was meant to be played 12 years ago. I'm sure it looks even more impressive in 4K, but sadly my eyes have not been blessed with that treat – godspeed if you can play it that way.

Beyond the stunning visuals, the game itself involves you controlling the wolf-god Amaterasu, a hero of legend who once vanquished the evil demon Orochi before he could destroy the world. 100 years later, someone has released Orochi from his prison, and it is up to Amaterasu to return to the world and save it once again. The story starts as a traditional Japanese tale of good versus evil, the kind you might expect. But it slowly opens up, introducing characters who are genuinely well-written and bring real warmth to this world. Even Issun, your little sprite helper, who starts out incredibly irritating (Imagine Navi from Ocarina of Time but worse), grows into a real character you will love to interact with – and still hate at times, but like a brother.

Structure-wise, the game follows the traditional Legend of Zelda formula: a largish overworld connecting challenging dungeons (this is pre-Breath of the Wild, of course). Yet, Clover Studios arguably perfected this style better than Nintendo had since Ocarina of Time. The world feels large, yet it is compact enough to avoid the aimless wandering some other open-world games suffer from. Unlike some titles that can feel vast but empty, Okami's world strikes a great balance between size and density.

Although Amaterasu wields weapons and can run and jump, the main gameplay element that truly sets Okami apart is her Celestial Brush. Inspired by the sumi-e painting style and the brushes used, this mechanic represents god-like powers. It allows the player to draw slices to cut down trees or paint in missing bridges. So not only does the game look like a sumi-e painting, but you, the player, get to add your own brush strokes to it. Essentially, the brush functions like items in a Zelda game: new powers are bestowed upon it, allowing you to progress into previously locked areas. It's a clever twist on the formula and works beautifully within the game's concept.

The minds behind Clover went on to form Platinum Games, known for excellent action titles like the Bayonetta series. It's no surprise, then, that the foundations of those combat systems can be seen in Okami – simplified, yes, but definitely there. The battle system is an interesting mix of hack-and-slash fighting combined with varied special abilities enabled by the Celestial Brush. During fights, the brush becomes a godlike weapon, allowing you to intervene and attack enemies from above, doing more damage than Amaterasu can alone. The battle system has more depth than any Zelda, with the game's artistic style woven elegantly into it. The use of combos and different abilities forms a smooth combat system, something Nintendo hasn't often prioritized for the Zelda series. Combat in Okami is a fun part of the game itself, not simply another obstacle.

Ultimately, Okami is a hard game not to fall in love with. From the stunning visuals to the loveable characters, Okami will pull you in until it's shown you everything it has, some 30+ hours later. Yes, it’s a long game, and my god, can those unskippable cutscenes drag on. But nothing is bad enough in Okami to truly diminish its shine. Okami represents a pinnacle in video game art direction and design; if you like games, you should play this one.
